            <p class="description">Description</p>
            <p class="book-description">It s easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed to write
                great Ruby code, you must go beyond syntax
                and absorb the Ruby way of thinking and problem solving. In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write
                Ruby like true
                Rubyists do so you can leverage its immense, surprising power. Olsen draws on years of experience
                internalizing the Ruby
                culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers. He guides you to the Ah Ha! moments when it suddenly
                becomes clear why
                Ruby works the way it does, and how you can take advantage of this language s elegance and
                expressiveness. Eloquent Ruby
                starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method, test, or bug. You ll
                learn how to
                write code that actually looks like Ruby (not Java or C#); why Ruby has so many control structures; how
                to use strings,
                expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really good for. Next, the book addresses bigger
                questions related
                to building methods and classes. You ll discover why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to
                use operator
                overloading, and when to avoid it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code and
                why you ll want
                to. He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain
                Specific Languages. A
                part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series, Eloquent Ruby will help you put on your
                Ruby-colored
                glasses and get results that make you a true believer."</p>
